          Rails Girls Manchester is primarily focused on providing a comfortable learning space for anyone who identifies as a girl or woman, in response to the lack of gender diversity at mainstream tech events. It is part of an attempt to make the tech industry more welcoming by creating a diverse community of peers and role models. Rails Girls Manchester is a transgender inclusive event.
        </p>
        <p>
          We value the participation of each member of the Rails Girls Manchester community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees and coaches are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the event and at all related events.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, organisers and volunteers at any Rails Girls Manchester event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <a id="user-content-the-short-version" class="anchor" href="#the-short-version" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
          The Short Version
        </h3>
        <p>
          Rails Girls Manchester is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
        </p>
        <p>
          All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave at the sole discretion of the conference organisers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
        </p>

          <a id="user-content-the-longer-version" class="anchor" href="#the-longer-version" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
          The Longer Version
        </h3>
        <p>
          Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; it also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
          <br>Organisers, volunteers, sponsors or similar are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, presenters should not use sexualised images, activities, or create a sexualised environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for Rails Girls Manchester.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion.
