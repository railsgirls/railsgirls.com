<!--   How to change the picture & header for site
In the assets folder there is something called rg-header.psd. Be sure to download the fonts also. Name the file rg-yourcityname-header.png and your city picture rg-yourcityname.png. Add them to /images. 

Steps to show on site
1. Go to style.css
2. Add two lines, always replacing 'yourcityname' with your actual city name. 

        .yourcityname#promo {
          padding-left:340px;
          background:url('../images/rg-yourcityname.png') no-repeat 0 10px,
                         url('../images/separator.png') no-repeat center bottom;
        }

        .yourcityname#promo h1 {
          background:url('../images/rg-yourcityname-header.png') no-repeat left top;
        }

        It will take a while before the changes show, so don't panic!

        <p>
          We are very sad to announce that RailsGirls at June in Kiev 2014 has to be cancelled.<br/>

	    were canceled this year.
	    We hope you understand the circumstances under which we have taken this decision.<br/>
	  We will organile workshop as soon as the situation in Ukraine gets more stable.<br/><br/>

	  Cheers,<br/>

	  Kiev, RG team.
