      <h2> Rails Girls Next </h2>
      <p>
        Rails Girls Next is a day-long unconference that provides women the chance to talk about the topics they care about most in a comfortable setting. Participants decide on the discussion topics at the beginning of the day together. Topics will be both technical and non-technical and will be discussed in small groups (no more than ~30 women in a group). All levels are welcome and you will also have an opportunity to meet with Rails Girls Workshop participants. More information on unconferences can be found <a href =" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You don't have to be a Rails Girls workshop alum to attend. If you are looking to get into developing for the first time, we encourage you to apply to the Rails Girls DC Workshop.
